        <section>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</section>
        <div>
        <p class="ingredient-title">Ingredients:</p>
        <ul class="ingredients"> 
            <li>1 16 ounce ball of pizza dough, 12 to 16 ounces is fine</li>

            <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>5 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, about 1 and 1/4 cups</li>
            <li>2.5 ounces pepperoni , about half a 5 oz package</li>

        <p class="ingredient-title">Steps:</p>
        <ol class="ingredients"> 
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. If your oven doesn’t go that high, preheat to 475 degrees for at least 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>The recipe makes about 1 1/2 pounds of dough. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface, free-form the dough with your hands into two 12-inch oblongs or rounds or make one quarter sheet-pan sized pizza.</li>
            <li>If you like, use a pizza stone in the oven and use your favorite tools such as a pizza peel for transferring the pizza.</li>
            <li>Top with about 1/2 cup homemade pizza sauce, tomato sauce, cheese or any of your other favorite toppings.
            </li>
