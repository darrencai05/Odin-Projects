        <p class="ingredient-title">Ingredients:</p>
        <ul class="ingredients"> 
            <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons soy sauce more or less to taste</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons green onions, chopped, optional
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="ingredient-title">Steps:</p>
        <ol class="ingredients"> 
            <li>Season the eggs. Whisk them with a bit of sesame oil, aminos and salt.</li>
            <li>Cook the veggies! Stir-fry the carrots. A few minutes later, add the onions, and right at the end, add the garlic. Set them aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs. Quickly stir-fry / scramble the eggs in a bit of vegetable oil until they’re just set. Add them to your bowl of carrots and onions.</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed</li>
            <li>Heat a little vegetable oil and sesame oil, then fry the rice by spreading it in a solid, even layer in the hot pan. Let the rice fry undisturbed for a few minutes, then toss it around a bit and let it fry again. Repeat this about four times.</li>
            <li>Bring it all together! Carrots, peas, eggs—just add them frozen, they’ll warm up as you incorporate them—green onions, plus a little more coconut aminos and soy sauce. If it still needs salt, add to taste and then it’s time to eat!</li>
