      <p class="title">Play lost ark</p>
      <p>Why play Lost Ark? Lost Ark's character mechanics and combat unfold at a steady pace — the grind to level 50 teaches the basics — but the endgame is the true challenge. It can be a bit grindy at times, but it never stops feeling rewarding, especially since the combat-focused content feels more involved than most games of its ilk.</p>

        <p>Warrior - Warriors are Arkesia's powerhouses. They may not be the most agile, but they stand firm and compensate for their lack of mobility with devastating offensive abilities. They focus on the strength stat which is the main damage attribute for their weapons.</p>
        <p>Assassin - The Assassin are close-ranged fighters who harness demonic power. They make up for their lack of vitality with their mobility. This class is recommended if you want to excel as a Melee Burst DPS and evade enemies before they attack you</p>
        <p>Mage - The Mage class uses their spells at long range, meaning the class has a high potential damage output as well as ranged versatility, at the cost of the physicality and vitality that other classes in the Steam record-breaking Lost Ark possess. That's not to say the Mage is restricted in its spell-centric gameplay.</p>
        <p>Martial Artist - Martial Artist is one of the main Classes in Lost Ark that allows players to experience different playstyles. It has five sub-classes. The first sub-class called Scrapper in Martial Artist is one the most balanced classes with good damage output. It has two playstyles; Taijutsu Playstyle, and ShockGen Playstyle.</p>

      <p class="quote-text">"First, there was the Ark and from it a new world was born: Arkesia. To safeguard its future, the Ark was split into seven pieces and scattered across Arkesia. Drawn by the light, armies of demons opened a rift between worlds and thus began the great chain wars. Only uniting the seven Arks could end the war and restore peace to Arkesia."</p>
